- 👋 Hi, I’m @mettakyle
- 🕴️ I am a computational social scientist working with NOAA's Weather Program Office on the development of the Integrated Societal-data Platform for Interdisciplinary Research and Evaluation (InSPIRE)
- 👀 I’m interested in social-ecolological systems and integrating social science with environmental data. I have expertize in fuzzy cognitive maps, social networks, agent-based modeling, and system dynamics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and exploring cloud computing for data integration platforms at NOAA. I am thinking about developing participatory methods for knowledge graph development and knowledge mapping.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open science initiatives, data-driven policy-making, and innovative ways to bridge the gap between scientific research and real-world applications.
